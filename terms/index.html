Simply, by continuing to use the CharityDrops website and service, you agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions set forth below.<div id="tos"></div><h1> Terms of Service</h1><hr/><p></p>CharityDrops is a website and service to help people discover and support nonprofits.<p></p>On CharityDrops,&#160;donors&#160;signup to donate to our featured nonprofits. Donors also receive email newsletters about the featured nonprofits, which they can, of course, unsubscribe from.<p></p>People who aren&#8217;t donors can also signup to receive email newsletters about featured nonprofits.<h2>Payments</h2><p></p>When you donate through CharityDrops, you agree to donate to the nonprofit beneficiaries we review and select.<p></p>CharityDrops collects a small (so we can continue to keep the service alive and make this our full-time position) amount (7.5%) of the total donation amount with a completely
optional
$1 or more donation to the service (that can be turned on or off in the account management page of any user).<p></p>CharityDrops is a service created by IdeaDrops Inc., which is a public benefit entity (means we are legally required to only do work that benefits society and the environment. To make it even simpler: We are legally required to make the world a better place).<p> </p>The charge on your billing statement will be from CharityDrops.<p></p>By signing up as a donor, you authorize CharityDrops to charge your credit card on a 30-day or 31-day cycle. Donors will receive payment confirmation by email with details about their charges.<p></p>CharityDrops uses Stripe, Inc. to process payments (third party transaction fees are not a part of CharityDrops&#8217; transaction fee).<h2> Cancellation</h2><p></p>You may cancel future donations at any time. If you cancel, donations will be completed to the nonprofit beneficiaries for cycle you&#8217;ve last paid. Simply, there are no refunds for cancellation mid-cycle, but you will not be charged again.<h2> We hope it&#8217;s never necessary, but...</h2><p></p>We reserve the right to remove any nonprofit beneficiary at any time for any reason without prior notice. In the event that we do remove a nonprofit beneficiary, the donations that would have been given to that nonprofit beneficiary will be designated to another, chosen at our sole discretion. The newly designated nonprofit will, of course, be publicly viewable, and be selected using our publicly viewable selection criteria.<p></p>We also reserve the right to cancel anyone&#8217;s use of CharityDrops for any reason. Not sure why we&#8217;d need to do this, but hey you never know.<h2> The lawyers say we need this at the bare minimum...</h2><p>Your access to and use of CharityDrops is at your own risk.</p><p></p>You agree to hold us and our service providers harmless from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and other legal costs, that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of CharityDrops, or otherwise from your violation of the Terms of Use, or infringement by you, or any third party using your account, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity.<p> </p>CharityDrops is not intended for children under the age of 13.<p></p>These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of State of Arkansas, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws. You agree that any dispute between you and us will be resolved solely in the U.S. State Arkansas.<p id="privacy"></p>We reserve the right to change our website, Terms of Use, or Privacy Policy at any time.
